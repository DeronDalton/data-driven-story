Slug: MulticulturalMusicMillennials

<p class="lead">Why We Care Now: According to Nielsen research, "Millennials are more racially and ethnically diverse than any previous generation in the U.S." This is important because African-American, Asian-American and Hispanic consumers are driving music industry trends and are more likely to be early adopters of new technologies and devices. U.S. Census Bureau projections show these groups to be the majority of the population by 2043. They currently spend more on music and are more socially engaged than the non-Hispanic white population. For Millennial Facebook users, Hip hop is currently the most popular genre of music, while hip hop itself is in a state of gentrification. Millennials have a large say in how hip hop will evolve. They continue to be music influencers and represent consumer buying habits that are important in the future.

Who cares: Online streaming services, social media, smartphone carriers and other technology driven companies supporting the music industry. Because of the spending power of this diverse generation marketing and sales people should also be paying close attention as well as artists looking to engage audiences in a new way.
