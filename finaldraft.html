<center><h2>MUSIC FESTIVALS & MULTICULTURAL MILLENNIALS</h2></center>
<p class="lead">Forty percent of millennials identify as African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic, making millennials more racially and ethnically diverse than any previous generation in the U.S. Multicultural millennials are spending more on music annually, and are attending more live concerts and music festivals than non-Hispanic white consumers, making them an important group for companies to market.</p>

<p class="text-center"> The music festival season is well under way with <a href="http://sxsw.com/"> SXSW </a> and <a href="https://www.coachella.com/splash/"> Coachella </a> having already kicked off, but with more popular festivals approaching you'll find marketers are targeting millennials more than ever. 

<p class="text-center"><a href="http://imgur.com/0iDJHrv"><img src="http://imgur.com/0iDJHrv.jpg" width=90%  /></a><p>
<p class="text-center"> *According to Eventbrite the top three most talked about U.S. music festivals via social media are Electric Zoo (7.58%), Electric Daisy Carnival (6.76%) and Coachella (6.73%)</p>

<br>

<p> It's no surprise marketers are targeting millennials as the majority of concertgoers are between the ages of <a href="http://eventbrite-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/marketing/MusicFestivalResearch/EventbriteStudyMusicFestivals8_25_14.pdf"> 18-34 </a> and their annual spending power is projected to reach up to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/industries/financial-services/gen-y-survey-report-165297.pdf"> $2.5 trillion </a> this year. As their spending power increases it’s important for marketers to know who the millennial is as well as what their role is in the music industry. </p>

<p>According to the <a href= "http://www.census.gov/"> U.S. Census </a> the millennial generation is projected to surpass the outsized baby boom generation in 2015 as the nation’s largest living generation. Immigration is playing a role in increased numbers. African-Americans, Asian-Americans and Hispanics currently make up 40 percent of the millennial population. These groups, called multicultural millennials, are projected to be the majority of the overall population by 2043.</p>

<p class="text-center"> *While minorities now account for 37% of the US population, by 2060, they will comprise 57% share. (In this case, the term “minorities” is defined as all residents save for the single-race non-Hispanic white population.) No single group will be in the majority.

<p>Multicultural millennials are important to the music industry because they are the current leaders in musical trends and overall spending. These young consumers, known as <a href= "http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/meet-the-millennial-multicultural-music-listener.html"> multicultural consumers</a>, spend an average of $7 more on music per year and are attending more live concerts and music festivals versus non-Hispanic white consumers. They are also creating new ways to buy, discover and share music through smartphones, online streaming and social media. With social media becoming an important part of marketing at music festivals it’s important for brands to recognize the multicultural music consumer.

<p>Multicultural consumers also react more positively to <a href= "http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/meet-the-millennial-multicultural-music-listener.html"> music engagement via brand marketing </a> versus the total market. Music festivals are a great place to reach multicultural millennials, who, according Nielsen's Music 360 Report, say music provides a connection to their unique identity and cultural journey.</p> 

<p>Sponsors are currently paying tens of thousands to well over <a href= "http://www.wsj.com/articles/coachella-is-next-in-the-marketing-march-on-music-festivals-1428444332">  a million dollars</a> to be part of the music festival movement. Festivals like Coachella have featured sponsors like H&M, Samsung and Heineken, and companies like Starbucks and McDonald's are proving to be effective marketers via social media. Brands also have the opportunity to market leading up to music festivals. A <a href= "http://www.livenationentertainment.com/"> Live Nation </a> report shows about eight in 10 festival goers purchased something in preparation of the event. Half of consumers bought shoes while two thirds spent money on clothing. With so many marketing opportunities this is a chance for companies to make multicultural consumers a part of their process.</p>

<p class="text-center"> (Blue represents music festival attendees. Pink represents Twitter users not in attendance.)</p>

<p class="text-center"> *Eventbrite compiled a list of over 9,000 Twitter users from 181 music festivals in the U.S. to prove that social media marketing was a good way to reach audiences and their preferences. The study compiled branded and popular unbranded hashtags in their research to analyze users social media brand engagement.</p>

<p>When it comes to reaching multicultural millennials one big takeaway from the <a href= "http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2014/meet-the-millennial-multicultural-music-listener.html"> Listen Up: Music and Multicultural Report </a>is that brands need to remain authentic. From the goods they purchase to their interaction with companies millennials, in general, will weed out the phony in favor of authentic and distinct brand marketing. With multicultural millennials soon to be the new mainstream in music their voice is important. So whether it's allowing them to engage in two-way conversations through social media or giving them the power to become brand ambassadors themselves, marketing to multicultural consumers may help companies capitalize in the live music industry.</p>
