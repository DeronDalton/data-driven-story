<h2>THE MUSIC INDUSTRY & MULTICULTURAL MILLENNIALS</h2>
<p class="lead">Multicultural music consumers (African-Americans, Asian-Americans and Hispanics) are driving the music industry by spending more on live concerts, music festivals and accounting for 31 percent of total spending on music in the U.S. They are trendsetters who are creating new ways to buy, discover and share music. Neilsen reports say companies that wish to understand the future of music need to pay close attention to this growing demographic's consumer habits.

<p>As of 2014 <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2015/everyone-listens-to-music-but-how-we-listen-is-changing.html"> Nielsen’s Music 360 </a> study shows that 93 percent of the U.S. population listens to music more than 25 hours each week. 75 percent of Americans say they actively choose to listen to music, which is more than they claim to actively watch television at 73%.</p>

<p>In 2014 Americans streamed 164 billion on-demand tracks across audio and video platforms, surging past the 106 billion from the previous year. In a report by the <a href="http://riaa.com/media/D1F4E3E8-D3E0-FCEE-BB55-FD8B35BC8785.pdf"> Recording Industry Association of America </a> streaming services outpaced CD sales for the first time in 2015 accounting for $1.87 billion in revenue, while CDs represented $1.85 billion.</p>

<p>On average, U.S. consumers report spending $109 each year on music. Album sales continue to be a part of spending habit, but live events now account for more than half of total music spending each year. The biggest consumers of live concerts and music festivals are Multicultural millennial consumers. According to the <a href="http://www.nielsencommunity.com/report_files/Multicultural_Music_ReportAsian_American_FINAL.pdf"> Listen Up: Music & the Multicultural Consumer </a> report they are spending $50 on live music annually, compared with $48 for non-Hispanic white consumers.</p>

<p>As a generation millennials identify with technology and music the most. Millennials believe that technology is affecting their lives positively, more so than any other generation. Millennials are the demographic group following Generation X, born tentatively between 1980 – 1997. According to the U.S. Census Bureau the Millennial generation is projected to surpass the outsized Baby Boom generation as the nation’s largest living generation. The Millennial population was 74.8 million in 2014. By 2015 Millennials will increase in size to 75.3 million.</p>

<p>Millennials are more racially and ethnically diverse than any previous generation in the U.S. - 40 percent identify as African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic. and U.S. Census Bureau projections show these groups to be the majority of the population by 2043. </p>

<p>The American consumer is, and will continue to be shaped by the multicultural consumer and already dominate the music business. According to Nielsen’s Music 360 report:</p>
<p>African-American, Asian-American, and Hispanic consumers represent the vanguard of musical trends in the U.S. They drive the development of musical taste and they’re readily adopting new ways of consuming music. So as this group of multicultural consumers continues to pioneer pathways of taste and adoption, companies interested in understanding the future of music would be well served to keep this growing demographic at the top of their engagement lists.<p>

<p>Multicultural consumers use multiple devices to listen to music and are more likely to share what they find about musical artists and bands on Facebook, Twitter, email and other digital mediums.<p>

<p>Millennials use smartphones more than any other generation, making mobile an efficient way to reach them. Multicultural consumers are more likely to listen to music on mobile devices such as Android smartphones, iPhones and PC laptops. </p>

<p class="text-center"> <a href="http://placehold.it/300&text=new+graph+millennials+and+technology"><img src="http://placehold.it/300&text=new+graph+millennials+and+technology" /></a> <p>

<p>Millennials overall are more receptive to celebrity endorsements and they’re more likely to buy brand products from companies that sponsor events for their favorite music artists. However, marketers are leveraging brands to meet new music needs by targeting the multicultural millennial consumer who spends $7 more a year on music and $2 more on live concerts and music festival than the total market.</p>

<p>Multicultural consumers react more positively to music engagement via brand marketing than the total market.</p>

<p>Brands are marketing more and more at music festivals, and reaching the multicultural consumer should be important. 48% of multicultural consumers respond favorably to a brand sponsoring a tour of their favorite artist. According to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/coachella-is-next-in-the-marketing-march-on-music-festivals-1428444332"> The Wall Street Journal </a> festivals like the recent 2015 Coachella as well as Lollapolooza and the Ultra Music Festival are attracting fashion, tech and beauty companies beyond the usual beverage and snack sponsors. Later this year Mercedez Benz will be the official automotive sponsor at Rock & Rio’s music festival in Las Vegas, marking the luxury brands first sponsorship of a U.S. festival. </p>

<p>Milennials use music as an emotional touchpoint. <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/12/music-millennial-marketing/"> Mashable </a> recently reported that millennials are receptive when music and brands come together for social good. Millennials tend to be a cause oriented demographic and they can use music as a medium to make changes.</p>
<p> Warner Brother Records EVP Lori Feldman believes music can connect people to other people, images on screens and even their own emotions. For millennials they are making connections through music online, at live shows and festivals, and will continue to be at the forefront of music engagement through technology as well as diversity. </p>

<p>According to the Listen Up: Music & the Multicultural Consumer report:</p>
 
<p>Multicultural millennials say music provides a connection to their unique identity and cultural journey. Some musicians are seen as role models who personify their personal experiences, often giving a voice to youth and the community. And Millennials as a whole are influenced by celebrity endorsements: 50 percent of Millennials will try a brand/product if a celebrity sponsors an event for a music artist they like.

But keep it real. From the goods they purchase to their interaction with companies, Millennials put a premium on authenticity, creativity, scarcity and distinctiveness. They believe and admire celebrities that are social and engaged with their fans, so celebrity endorsements presented in a real/authentic way to appeal to them. Creating a two-way conversation through social media will allow these young and diverse consumers provide input and, better yet, become brand ambassadors.</p>
