<p><h3> Multicultural Music Listeners </h3></p>
<p>The American consumer is, and will continue to be shaped by the multicultural consumer and already dominate the music business. According to Nielsen’s Music 360 report:</p>
<p>African-American, Asian-American, and Hispanic consumers represent the vanguard of musical trends in the U.S. They drive the development of musical taste and they’re readily adopting new ways of consuming music. So as this group of multicultural consumers continues to pioneer pathways of taste and adoption, companies interested in understanding the future of music would be well served to keep this growing demographic at the top of their engagement lists.<p>

<p><h3>Identifying with Technology </h3>
<p>As a generation millenials identify with technology and music the most. Millenials believe that technology is affecting their lives positively, more so than any other generation. Multicultural consumers use multiple devices to listen to music and are more likely to share what they find about musical artists and bands on Facebook, Twitter, email and other digital mediums.<p>

However, marketers are leveraging brands to meet new music needs by targeting the multicultural millennial consumer who spends $7 more a year on music and $2 more on live concerts and music festival than the total market.</p>

<p> Warner Brother Records EVP Lori Feldman believes music can connect people to other people, images on screens and even their own emotions. For millennials they are making connections through music online, at live shows and festivals, and will continue to be at the forefront of music engagement through technology as well as diversity. </p>
